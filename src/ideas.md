Here's a detailed logic breakdown for your speed dating platform concept:

### Core Features & Logic Flow

**1. Two Modes:**
- **A. Private Speed Dating Events (Link-Based)**
- **B. Public Matchmaking (Algorithm-Based)**

---

### **A. Private Event Logic**
*(Creator ‚Üí Invitees Model)*

1. **Event Creation:**
   - Creator sets parameters:  
     - Date/time, duration per "date" (e.g., 5 mins)
     - Optional: Age range, gender preferences, interests
     - Max participants (e.g., 10 people = 9 rounds)
   - System generates a **unique URL** for the event.

2. **Joining the Event:**
   - Users access via link ‚Üí redirected to registration/login.
   - Profile auto-pulls basic info (if logged in) + lets users add event-specific tags (e.g., "Into hiking", "Looking for serious relationships").

3. **Pre-Event Setup:**
   - **Pairing Logic:**  
     - If creator set preferences: Filter participants first (e.g., age 25-30), then use round-robin pairing.  
     - If no preferences: Randomize pairs but ensure no repeats.

4. **Event Execution:**
   - **Countdown Start:** All participants must join 5 mins before event begins.
   - **Automated Rotations:**  
     - Timer triggers video/chat transitions.  
     - Screen shows "Next match: John in 10 seconds..." with optional icebreaker question.
   - **User Controls:**  
     - "Skip" button (limited uses to avoid abuse).  
     - "Report" button for inappropriate behavior.

5. **Post-Event:**
   - **Match Results:**  
     - Users secretly rate each interaction (üëç/üëé).  
     - Mutual likes ‚Üí contact info shared via email.  
   - **Analytics:** Creator gets stats (e.g., "80% matches happened between rock climbers").

### **B. Public Matchmaking Logic**
*(Algorithm-Driven Model)*

1. **Profile Setup:**
   - Users specify:  
     - Core preferences (dealbreakers: smoking, kids, etc.).  
     - Interests (tags: #BoardGames, #Travel).  
     - Availability (e.g., "Free every Tuesday 8 PM").  

2. **Matching Algorithm:**
   - **Tier 1 Filters:** Dealbreakers, location, age.  
   - **Tier 2 Scoring:**  
     - Interest overlap (shared tags = higher score).  
     - AI analysis of profile bios for compatibility (optional).  
   - **Batch Scheduling:** Group 10 compatible users ‚Üí auto-schedule weekly sessions.

3. **Dynamic Question Engine:**
   - **Predefined Pool:** 500+ vetted questions (e.g., "What‚Äôs your dream vacation?").  
   - **AI Personalization:**  
     - Scans user profiles ‚Üí suggests relevant questions (e.g., "Both like sci-fi ‚Üí ask about favorite Star Trek character").  
   - **Adaptive Flow:** If users mention "sushi" in chat, inject follow-up: "Plan a sushi date: California roll or sashimi?"

4. **Post-Session Feedback:**
   - Rate matches + flag mismatches to refine future algorithms.  
   - "Super Like" option to prioritize mutual matches.

### **Unified Systems**

**User Flow Integration:**
- Dashboard toggles between "My Private Events" and "Public Matches".
- Notifications for upcoming sessions + post-event summaries.

**Safety/Moderation:**
- Mandatory photo verification.  
- AI monitors chats for red flags (harassment, spam).  
- Optional anonymous mode (hide name/photo until mutual like).

**Monetization Hooks:**
- **Private Events:** Pay to unlock longer sessions, premium questions, or detailed analytics.  
- **Public Matches:** Subscription tiers for priority matching or extra Super Likes.  
- **In-App Purchases:** "Boost my profile" for increased visibility.

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Timezone-aware scheduling.  
- Backup pairs if users drop mid-event.  
- Low-bandwidth mode (text-only dates).

### Example Scenario
*Private Event:*  
Sarah creates a "Cat Lovers Speed Dating" link, shares it on Reddit. 12 users join. The system pairs people based on cat breed preferences. Post-event, 3 mutual matches get each other‚Äôs Instagram handles.  

*Public Match:*  
John opts into the algorithm. He‚Äôs paired with Lisa (both love indie films and tacos). Their chat starts with AI-generated: "If you directed a movie about tacos, what genre would it be?"

This balances user control (private links) with smart automation (public matches). Would you expand on any section?
